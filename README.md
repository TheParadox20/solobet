## Intro
Solobet is a P2P betting platform that focuses on 3 markets: 

- Sports betting
- Prediction markets
- Multiplayer gaming. 

The betting industry is huge globally and more so in Kenya, Africa, tapping into this large user base and incentivizing them to use crypto networks for asset transfer through low to zero commission charged if stakes are placed through crypto wallets. This incentive will hopefully encourage more users to move on-chain. Apart from low commission charges SoloBet also abstracts complexities found in funding of wallets. Users with connected wallets can deposit fiat which is then automatically converted to ETH through our smart contract. Users will transact using crypto without realising it.

The decentralised nature of our platform emphasises on fairness, where traditional bookmakers ("the house") are removed from the equation. The house can’t win when there is no house. All funds staked in the system are distributed fairly among other players. This results in insanely high odds with little to no exposure (potential loss) from our end. Compared to traditional systems where bookmakers control the odds and edge them to their advantage in our system the people determine the odds and benefit more, both in sports and prediction markets. Our business model relies primarily on commissions as a source of revenue and forex interconversion as a secondary option.

Finally through gamers’ lounge marketplace. Gamers are able to showcase their prowess for a chance to win rewards from other players stakes if they win. In this market it's survival of the fittest—only the most skilled gamers rise to the top and reap the rewards. Players can also be staked on by other uses and if they win a percentage of our commission is used to award them. Pro players will get a steady stream of income through our platform.
